## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Renderpeople** | $19-49/person | High quality 3D scans | Expensive, limited poses |
| **ArchViz People** | $29-79/bundle | Curated collections | Generic, static poses |
| **Skalgubbar** | Free | Free, quirky variety | No control, inconsistent quality |
| **Cutout Mix** | $10-30/pack | Mixed styles | Limited diversity |
| **Midjourney/DALL-E** | $10/mo subscription | Unlimited generation | No transparent BG, no control |

**Our Moat:** Flipping the model. Instead of buying pre-made, you generate exactly what you need. Prompt = "elderly couple walking toward camera" → Get exactly that, with transparency, for $1.

## Pricing Strategy

| Tier | Current | Consider |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Starter** | 5 for $5 | Keep (low friction) |
| **Standard** | 10 for $10 | Keep (good value) |
| **Bulk** | 25 for $20 | Good, maybe add 50 for $35 |
| **Studio** | (none) | Add: 100 for $60 (20% discount) |
| **Enterprise** | (none) | Add: Monthly subscription + API access |

**Psychological Pricing:**
- Credit packs = "I'll buy when I need it" (low commitment)
- Subscription = "I should use it more" (retention risk)
- Recommendation: Keep credit packs, add optional subscription later
